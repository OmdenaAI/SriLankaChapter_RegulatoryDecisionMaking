| `filename`              | The name of the PDF file or the text file (with `.txt` extension).                                              |
| `path`                  | The file path to the original document (PDF or text).                                                           |
| `url`                   | The URL from which the document was scraped or collected.                                                      |

## Dataset Formats

### Text Content (`text_content`)
- Raw text content extracted directly from documents, typically unclean and unformatted. This column is used for understanding and requires advanced parsing for correct structure and table extraction.

### Cleaned Markdown Content (`markdown_content`)
- Cleaned content that includes layout information extracted using `llamaparse`. This is the preferred format for viewing the documents as it retains their structure. You can use [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) to view the formatted content.
