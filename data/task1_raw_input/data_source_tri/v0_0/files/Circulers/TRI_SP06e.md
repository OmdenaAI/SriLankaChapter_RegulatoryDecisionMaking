# FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REHABILITATION GRASSES (MANA AND GUATEMALA)

This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No. and Circular No. F 12, Serial No. 03/89, F 16, Serial No. 06/94, issued in June 1994 and issued in January 1989 on the use of fertiliser and dolomite for rehabilitation grasses:

# 1.0 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone

Dolomite is recommended at the rate of 2000, 3000 and 4000 kg per ha for the low country (below 600m), mid-country (600-1200m) and up country (above 1200m), respectively. This quantity of dolomite should be distributed evenly on the soil surface before planting grass. However, if the soil pH level is above 5.5, dolomite application should be avoided.

# 2.0 Fertiliser mixture for grasses

The mixture U625 is recommended for rehabilitation grasses.

# 2.1 Composition of U625

|225 parts|Urea|(46% N)|
|---|---|---|
|250 parts|Eppawela rock phosphate|(28.5% P2O5)|
|150 parts|Muriate of potash|(60% K2O)|
|Total|Total|625 parts|

The mixture contains approximately 16.6% N, 11.4% P2O5 and 14.4% K2O.

# 2.2 Quantity and times of application

Apply 160 kg of U625 mixture at the time new shoots sprout; 210 kg/ha after the 1st lopping, and 310 kg/ha each after the 2nd and 3rd lopping.
